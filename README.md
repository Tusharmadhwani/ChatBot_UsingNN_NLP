## Types of Chat Bot's:

## Install Packages:
Before starting to work on our chatbot we need to download a few python packages. Please note as of writing this these packages will ONLY WORK IN PYTHON 3.6. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.
We will simply use pip to install the following:
- numpy
- nltk
- tensorflow
- tflearn

Simply go to CMD and type: pip install "package name". Where you will replace "package_name" with all of the entries listed above.

## Training Data
Now it's time to understand what kind of data we will need to provide our chatbot with. Since this is a simple chatbot we don't need to download any massive datasets. We will just use data that we write ourselves. To follow along with the tutorial properly you will need to create a .JSON file that contains the same format as the one seen below. I've called my file "chatbot.json".

## Steps involved in the project:
- Loading our JSON Data
- Extracting Data
- Word Stemming
- Bag of Words
- Developing a Model	
- Training & Saving the Model
- Loading a Model
- Making Predictions
